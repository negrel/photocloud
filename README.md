# üñºÔ∏è `photocloud`- A modular cloud photos.

A modular cloud photos made of the following components:
- [`syncthing`](https://syncthing.net/): a continuous file synchronization program.
- [`photosort`](https://github.com/negrel/photosort): a pictures/files organizer.
- [`photoview`](https://photoview.github.io/): a photo gallery server sync with your filesystem.

Each component is optional and can be replaced depending of your need. For
example, you could replace `photoview` with an FTP server (or deploy it along).

## Utils scripts

### `exif_fix.sh`

A simple bash scripts based on `exiftool` that adds missing date exif metadata.
Date is determined based on parent directories.
For example, it will add `2022:09:01 00:00:00` date to any file under `path/to/a/dir/2022/09` directory.
It can only determine year and month currently.

#### Usage

```shell
# Recursively fix every files under /path/to/directory1 and /path/to/directory2
# A maximum of 1024 parallel jobs
MAX_JOBS=1024 ./exif_fix.sh /path/to/directory1 /path/to/directory2
```

### `list_removed.sh`

Recursively list files that can be deleted from `photos/sorted` directory.
A files can be deleted if:
- file is a symbolic link that points to no file.
- file is a regular file with a link count of 0 (no hardlink).

This scripts should be run only under `photos/sorted` directory.
It should not be used on files replicated using `copy` replicator (it will list all files).

#### Usage

```shell
# List every sorted photos that should be removed in ./photos/sorted/
# A maximum of 1024 parallel jobs
MAX_JOBS=1024 ./list_removed.sh ./photos/sorted/

# Delete replicated files whose original has been deleted
# NOTE: USE WITH CAUTION
# NOTE: The script won't list any file under a .*sync.* directory by default
./list_removed.sh ./photos/sorted | xargs rm -f
```

This scripts is used by the `cron` service to delete sorted files whose original
has been removed.
